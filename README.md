# Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Platform

A firmware engineering project implementing **reactive autonomous navigation** and **3-DOF manipulation** on a differential-drive chassis. Developed in C++ for the ATmega328P (Arduino Uno), this system integrates ultrasonic time-of-flight sensing with PWM motor control to execute real-time collision avoidance.
